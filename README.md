**Hey, this is a small project of mine for Minecraft servernetworks that adds features such as automatic config creation for worlds and world creation via UI.
I copied to Paginated UI from Kody Simpson because I was to lazy to code my own up until now, so credits to him :)
Feel free to fork this Project or contributer into it! Thx <3**

**TO-DO:**
- [X] Add config creation with templates etc. and add world creation with settings like daylight/weathercycle, emptyness, spawnMobs, name, templateName, biome.
- [X] Added Search function for Worlds.
- [X] Added Stats, tp and deletion function for World in UI.
- [X] Add /build show and /build hide command show should have a key for showing all locations in the configsection of <key>
- [X] Add /build add command for adding to a key in the config. If using location use ~ ~ ~ [~ ~] or <x> <y> <z> [pitch yaw]
- [X] Add /build for opening build menu.
- [ ] Cleanup configmanager and overall a little code overhaul.
